(Please don't use this to work out where I live)

# Current known issues (That I may or may not fix)

- The program breaks in antartica and similar areas (presumably due to the 6 month long days and nights)

- Program is untested in different timezones but I think it still works

- Code is really ugly

- Only availible in Python
